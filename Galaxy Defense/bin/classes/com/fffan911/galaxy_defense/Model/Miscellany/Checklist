Things to Do:

Immediate Tasks:
- Implement a way to adjust a Weapon's Element level(s) from Weapon or Ship / Composites
- Incorporate Elements into Weapon , etc.
- Have Elements exhibit their background animation when active
- Fix addElement() in Ship: when an element is already active, decide what to do

Background Tasks:
- Test SpecialWeapon upgrades and evolutions
- Implement Element Levels in Composite (esp. Core and WeaponBarrels)
- Use "getEquipment..." methods instead of for loops in Ship
- Fix Activity Switching issue (see StoryStage_0_2 victory task issue)
- Make a 'Continue' Button in Shop

- Implement a loading screen
- Make Currently Equipped Weapon Textfield for Side Panel
- Make ship wait to finish turning before starting to shoot
- Make Stage victory animation + Stage defeat / Game Over Screen
- Create Damage Animations

- Make SideJoystick less sticky (sticks when it goes past left/top side)
- Make WeaponButtons less sticky (fix something with multitouch)
- Create ObjectData
- Fix HealthBar redraw-er to have less of an FPS impact
- Fix trembling that occurs while paused
