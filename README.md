Galaxy Defense
=================

Author: Lance Goodridge
Description: A silly android game I started back in high school, and still add to on occasion. Half of it is a spinoff of Space Invaders, the other half is a free-control game mode I designed.
Environment: Written using Eclipse with ADT. Built and tested on my O.A.F Android running Gingerbread, so it probably doesn't even work on modern Android devices
